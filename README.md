**Context**
    This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective is to predict based on diagnostic measurements whether a patient has diabetes.

**Content**
    Several constraints were placed on the selection of these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

    Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
    Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
    BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
    SkinThickness: Triceps skin fold thickness (mm)
    Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
    BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
    DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
    Age: Age (years)
    Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
**Dependencies**
  To run this code, you will need the following dependencies:

  Python 3.x
  Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided Jupyter notebook)
  NumPy
  Pandas
  Matplotlib
  Scikit-Learn
  Seaborn

  You can install these dependencies using pip:
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn seaborn

  **How it works**
    Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

    1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

          git clone https://github.com/your-username/diabetes-analysis.git
    
    2.Navigate to the project directory:

          cd diabetes-analysis
     
    3. Optionally, you can create a virtual environment for this project:

          python -m venv venv
      source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`

     4. Install the required libraries:

            pip install -r requirements.txt

    **Usage**
       The main analysis can be performed by running the Jupyter Notebook included in this project. Here are the steps to run the notebook:

       Start Jupyter Notebook:
        
              jupyter notebook
     
      2. In your web browser, open the diabetes_analysis.ipynb notebook.

      3. Follow the instructions in the notebook to perform the analysis and generate insights and predictions.
          Alternatively, you can run the Python script if you prefer not to use Jupyter Notebook:

                 python diabetes_analysis.py
   
   **Data Source**
            The diabetes dataset used in this project is the Diabetes dataset available in the scikit-learn library. It is a commonly used dataset for diabetes prediction.
